# linear-regression-cooks-distance

## Concept: A brief look at a data set with two dependent variables, running regression and calculating the cook's distance.

### What data does the file have? 

The file contains a soccer data set with minutes played, age and total distance covered using the ball. 

### What does the file analyse?

I've tried to find if the minutes played depends on the age of the players or the distance covered by the players with the ball or both.

### Cook's distance

Cook's distance is a metric used to find the influential points or the outliers x variables. 

### Final output

Using linear regression, a prediction of the number of minutes is produced.
